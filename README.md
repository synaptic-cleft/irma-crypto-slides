# IRMA's Idemix core - Understanding the crypto behind selective, unlinkable attribute disclosure

[irma-crypto.pdf](./irma-crypto.pdf) contains the slides of the talk. You can build the pdf directly from the [tex file](./irma-crypto.tex). You can set the setbeameroption to either show the slides (`hide notes`) or the slides with notes (`show notes on second screen`) or only the notes (`show only notes`).

# Installation
```
brew cask install mactex
```
Then add the mactex location to your $PATH variable.

Run presentation with 
```
pympress irma-crypto.pdf
```

# LaTex tips
